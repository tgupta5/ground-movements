CLASSIFY UNITED GATES AT SFO

A challenge at congested hub airports is optimizing which aircraft go to which gate.
Each airline is restricted to certain gates, unless terminals are common use,
with each gate restricted to certain aircraft types.

Based on the expected turn time for upcoming flights, restrictions on int'l. vs. domestic aircraft,
and current gate availability, United ground control staff must determine where to optimally slot aircraft.

As a first step to addressing this optimization challenge, this application seeks to create a list
of all gates at EWR and SFO serving United, tracking what aircraft types park there and at what frequency.

From there, the algorithm will examine historical turn time patterns based on scheduled upcoming aircraft for that gate
to begin understanding the gating patterns.

A series of charts will also capture gate availability by aircraft type.
